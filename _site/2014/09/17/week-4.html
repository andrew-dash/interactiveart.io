<h3 class="text-muted">object oriented programming</h3>

<blockquote>OOP is the philosophy of creating classes that represent different tasks or objects in your application to delegate responsibility and organize the structure of your application. Classes can handle specific functionality like reading data from a camera and displaying it to a screen, they can represent a data object like a file, and they can be events for one part of an application to tell another about something that has happened. The class is the blueprint for what kind of object the class will create. When you create one of these classes to use in your application, you call that particular instance of the class an object. </blockquote>
