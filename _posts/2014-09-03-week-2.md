<p>
	This week is all about getting up and running with <a class="inline" href="https://github.com/olab-io/ofSketch">ofSketch</a>. Make sure you have <a class="inline" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12">Xcode</a> installed to ensure ofSketch will run properly. We will be referencing <a class="inline" href="https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook" target="_blank">ofBook</a> at times -- you can easily find relevant chapters <a class="inline" href="{{site.url}}/ofbook" target="_blank">here</a>.

</p>
<p>Work on your ofSketch exercises. Spend a few hours experimenting with the environment. Build on what we covered in class. Use the <a class="inline" href="http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/" target="_blank">openFrameworks documentation</a> to discover some things this platform has to offer. Or if you're familiar with processing <a class="inline" href="http://kylemcdonald.net/forof/processing-vs-of.html" target="_blank">this resource</a> could be very helpful. Your exercise for this assignment can be one sketch or multiple test-sketches.</p>
